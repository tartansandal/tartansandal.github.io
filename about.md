How did I get here? (Once in a life time)

Passionate Open Source advocate.

This is a place for me store notes on my adventures in Technology, Linux,
Fedora, DevOps, Virtualization, Programming, Maths and Logic, Machine Learning,
and Music Theory.

Best prcatices
Lightweight processes.
Getting things done.

Often I find myself following seamingless endless digressions on some topic as
I learn about new ideas and attempt to evaluate their utility.  These notes are
how I keep these explorations
focused and critical, and also prove the digressions do come to an end.  Mostly
a record of decisions and evaluations so I can answer the "How did I get here?"
question.

My primary desktop is a Fedora Linux system. I'm prety fussy about getting
things right.  Stackexchange is dominated by Ubuntu solutions. So my blogs will
often address setup and installation issues in that environent.
